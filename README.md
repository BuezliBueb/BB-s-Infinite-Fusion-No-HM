# BB-s-Infinite-Fusion-No-HM

## Description:

<p>This Mod lets you use HM's without having to actually teach them to your Pokemon</p>
<p>You still need to have the required Badge to use the HM. Currently working on a setting that checks wheter you have the HM in your Bag</p>

##Content:

<p>Following moves can be used outside of battle after you aquire the necessary Badge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rocksmash</li>
<li>Cut</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Rock Climb</li>
<li>Surf</li>
<li>Dive</li>
<li>Waterfall</li>
</ul>
<P>Teleport and Flash cannot be modified this way. I recommend my QOL mod where you can add the Items Teleporter and Lantern to your bag</P>
